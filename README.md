# draw-game

This game was based on the program called ImagineLogo, although my version is slightly worse but managable. It lacks important features (some are temporarly, while some are permanently absent) and there are probably bugs which I haven't discovered yet.
The program features a humble ladybug with a magical pen on its belly, which allows him/her/them (in the ladybug world we don't have pronouns or gender wars) to draw straight lines onto the canvas by the given commands. The program currently has six of these, which are the following (I have no idea how to start a new line here, GitHub help..):
-face: faces the given direction (a value in degrees, for example face 47.8)
-move: moves the given number of steps (fe. move 54)
-clear: clears the canvas
-color: changes the pen's color (supports some color names and hex values, fe. color blue, supported color names: ["white", "black", "red", "green", "blue", "cyan", "yellow", "magenta", "gold"])
-width: changes the thickness of the pen (fe. width 2.5)
-pen: lifts the pen up or puts it down (fe. pen up or pen down)
You can also view these by clicking the "help" button at the bottom of the screen. How it works is, you type in a desired command (only one at a time, as ladybugs can't understand more than two words at the same time, yet they can calculate the sine or cosine of an angle, but anyway), hit either Enter or the "do" button and watch with unrelenting attention as the ladybug performs what you told them like a good slave- I mean, a good, cute little pet.
Truth be told, I drew a house with this.
